If gas falls below this %, the lights turn off automatically.

Oxygen drains each day, big damage if o2 lvl = 0.
Oxygen changes daily based on scrubber power.  
Higher power = better oxygen but more fuel use.

Controls how hard the O₂ scrubber runs.
⬆️ Power = ⬆️ oxygen gain but ⬆️ gas usage.
⬇️ Power = slower oxygen recovery, less fuel used.

## Exterior Temperature

Prevents heat damage if temps are high.

## Radiation Level

## Ration Level (Low / Mid / High)
Controls how much food is consumed daily.  
Low = slow food use, low well-being gain.  
Mid = normal food use, normal gain.  
High = fast food use, high gain.
